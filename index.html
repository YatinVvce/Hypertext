                <p>
                    A Photograph is a gift of science which is always close to heart. Because it contains more memories of people near and far.Every photo simple or complex has a story to stay after become fresh in mind. It is a creation very small but is full of details, movement and emotions of a person. Photographs are taken from a gadget know as a camera,earlier there were big box shaped camera which had a shutter and could only capture black and white photes. But as time passed by were developments in the camera settings and the quality of the photograph as well. Nowadays Photographs clicked from high and definition camera are like reality, so beautifull and realistic. Their is also an old saying  "A picture is worth a thousand words"
